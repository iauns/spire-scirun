/// A reimplementation of Ken Shoemake's arcball camera. SCIRun 4's camera
/// system is based completely off of Ken's code. The Code appears in
/// Graphics Gems 4, III.1.
/// 
/// Unless specified otherwise, all calculations and variables stored in this
/// class are relative to the target coordinate system (TCS) for which there is
/// a transformation from screen space to TCS given by the screenToTCS
/// constructor parameter.
///
/// If the screenToTCS parameter in the constructor is left as the identity
/// matrix then all values are given in screen coordinates.
/// Screen coordinates are (x \in [-1,1]) and (y \in [-1,1]) where (0,0) is the
/// center of the screen.
/// \todo Extend this class to include Mouse screen coords -> object space
///       calculations. That way we can rotate around a particular object.
///       May also want to visually represent the sphere when we perform this
///       calculation.
/// \todo Provide method of setting the default orientation of the object.
